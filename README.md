First thing is to go [here](https://portal.apexlegendsapi.com/) and create your own API Key. This will auto-generate your API key, but this next step is very important otherwise this will not work. You need to verify your Discord Account in order to make 2 Requests in 1 Second. After you verify your Discord, you should just be able to plug everything in and it should work.
